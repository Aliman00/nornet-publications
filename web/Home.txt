Having stable and uninterrupted Internet connectivity is becoming increasingly important, particularly with regard to applications like cloud computing, service as a platform and many others. Connectivity problems could e.g.&nbsp;be caused by a hardware failure or a natural disaster. In order to improve the robustness of Internet connectivity, it is obvious to connect endpoints to multiple Internet service providers&nbsp;(ISP) simultaneously. This property is denoted as multi-homing. For example, Transport Layer protocols like the Stream Control Transmission Protocol&nbsp;(SCTP, RFC&nbsp;4960) or Session Layer frameworks like Reliable Server Pooling&nbsp;(RSerPool, RFC&nbsp;5351) make use of multi-homing to support availability-critical applications.

However, while in theory a failure of one ISP should be independent of other ISPs, it is not really known what happens in practise in today's commercial networks. It is evident that there are hidden dependencies among ISPs. Also, what about connectivity problems due to intentional malicious behaviour, i.e.&nbsp;targeted attacks on such systems? Research in realistic Internet setups is clearly necessary, in order to answer these open questions. For that purpose, the NorNet project is building up a multi-homed testbed distributed all over the country of Norway. NorNet is a programmable testbed for measurements and experimental networking research. It is built and operated by Simula Research Laboratory and financed by Forskningsr√•det (the Research Council of Norway). 

NorNet has two main components: NorNet Core and NorNet Edge. When fully operational, NorNet Core will consist of more than ten programmable core nodes, each multi-homed to several network providers. NorNet Edge will consist of several hundreds of smaller nodes connected to all mobile broadband providers in Norway. Together, these two components will offer a unique platform for experimental networking research. NorNet will be made available to the Norwegian and international networking research community.

NorNet is a programmable testbed for measurements and experimental networking research. It is built and operated by Simula Research Laboratory, and financed by the Research Council of Norway. NorNet fill an important role as a platform for large-scale testing of protocols and methods that are not yet ready for deployment in production networks.

NorNet has two main components: NorNet Core and NorNet Edge. When fully operational, NorNet Core will consist of more than 10 programmable core nodes, each multi-homed to several network providers. NorNet Edge will consist of several hundreds of smaller nodes connected to all mobile broadband providers in Norway. Together, these two components will offer a unique platform for experimental networking research. NorNet will be made available to the Norwegian and international networking research community. Access to the infrastructure is regulated, and priority will be given to projects with Norwegian partners.
